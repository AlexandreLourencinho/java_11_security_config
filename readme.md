# WIP
![wip alert](https://julienmorales.com/assets/img/portfolio/portfoliodetails/wip/wip.png)
Wip for a full prepared backend and frontend security application using jwt.

## re-usability

the point of this base application Should be its re-usability for any project that will need an account management part.

### Principle

The base application should be composed by a backend with full account management endpoints, with account creation,
signing action, modifying account possibility, deleting account possibility, roles management.
The frontend part should of course reflect these possibilities, with the addition of admin panel - or other types of
panels, such as moderator panel- according to the role of the user currently connected.
frontend part and backend part aren't currently communicating, working for now in the implementation of the frontend
after getting the work done on the backend - for what i've been able to test through simple http requests at least - .
